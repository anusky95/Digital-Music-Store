# Digital-Music-Store
Data analysis project using SQL for obtaining insights about digital music business. 

### About the project
This project was completed as part of the Udacity's Data Analysis scholarship Nanodegree program. These are some of the intermediate to complex queries used on the Music database to obtain insights about the data. 

### Data
The dataset for the project is contained in the Chinook Postgre SQL database.

### Insights
You can find some of the insights related to the project in the project submission PDF since the project required us to have 5 insights in place for the completion. Feel free to experiment with the SQL queries.


### Instructions for downloading the database and querying

Download your new database
Download DB Browser for SQLite
As soon as you have DB Broswer for SQLite connected to your new database you're ready for the next page!

1.  Download DB Browser for SQLite

1.a  DB Browser for SQLite can be downloaded here: http://sqlitebrowser.org/


Download Database
You can download the database we will be using for this project from the bottom of the page.

Connect the Browser to the Database
Here are the steps:

Open up DB Browser to SQLite
Click on Open Database
Navigate to the Chinook.db file (probably in your downloads)
Click on the Execute SQL
Start querying your data

Start Querying Your Data
The database Entity Relationship Diagram was provided in the previous concept, but you can also find it on the Chinook database homepage.

Once it looks like you have it all set up, you can start querying your database! First, we could have a look at all the data from the Invoice table:

SELECT * FROM Invoice;
Your first query, AWESOME!

Now check out what's in the Employee table.

SELECT * FROM Employee;
Looks like you are ready to take on this PROJECT and the WORLD! Everything you have been studying is going to come in handy now!
